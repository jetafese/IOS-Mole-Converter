# IOS-Mole-Converter
	Project started with the hopes of explaining the mole concept to high school chemistry students
	with an accessible interface. It morphed into a learning project for the language: Swift.

	Using the Object Oriented Programing paradigm, and data abstraction techniques such as the 
	implementation of a Stack, and the MVC design paradigm; the Mole Converting iOS application (Chem Helper) offers an 	    intuitive platform to perform calculations related to the molar concept and Avogadro's number.
	
	Can handle the number of: Moles to grams, Moles to Atoms, Grams to Atoms and vice versa for each operation.
