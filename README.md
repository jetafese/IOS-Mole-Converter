# IOS-Mole-Converter
	Project started with the hopes of explaining the mole concept to high school chemistry students
	with an accessible interface. It morphed into a learning project for the language: Swift.

	Using the Object Oriented Programing paradigm, and data abstraction techniques such as the 
	implementation of a Stack, the Mole Converter iOS application offers a platform to perform
	calculations related to the molar concept and Avogadro's number.
